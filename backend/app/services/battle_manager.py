"""
Battle Match Manager Service

Orchestrates the full lifecycle of ranked battle matches between two players.
Maintains match state, enforces game rules, handles WebSocket message routing,
and manages phase transitions from game start to completion.

Key Concepts:
  - Match: A complete game between two players (best-of-5 rounds)
  - Round: A single question set with a selected category (3 questions)
  - Phase: Current game state (waiting, picking, questions, finished)
  - Picker: The player who selects the category for the current round

Concurrency Model:
  Each MatchState has an asyncio.Lock to ensure thread-safe access to
  shared game state. All state mutations occur inside "async with state.lock",
  protecting concurrent player actions (e.g., both submitting answers simultaneously).

WebSocket Close Codes:
  - 4004 (Full): Match capacity reached (2 players already connected)
  - 4005 (Duplicate): Same user attempting to connect twice to the match

Match Flow (State Machine):
  1. connect() called by player 1
     → Phase: "waiting", send "waiting_for_opponent"
  2. connect() called by player 2
     → Trigger _start_game(), pick random first picker
  3. _start_game() sends "match_ready" to both
     → Trigger _start_round()
  4. _start_round() sends categories to picker, "waiting_for_category" to non-picker
     → Phase: "picking"
  5. picker chooses category → _handle_category_pick()
     → Phase: "questions", send "category_chosen", first question
  6. both players answer 3 questions (question → answer_result → next question)
  7. After 3 questions → _end_round()
     → Determine round winner, update round_wins, send "round_result"
  8. If a player reached ROUNDS_TO_WIN (3) → _end_game()
     → Otherwise loop to step 4 with next round
